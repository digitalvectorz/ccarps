Oddities
=======
Oddities are meant to add flavour to the characters in a group they are minor versions of the Prestige and Prejudices A character can take up to five oddities at a cost of -1 for each. For example Greed is a prejudice insisting on being paid in silver is an oddity. You may also buy off an oddity by paying 1 character point, but you really shouldn’t do that. Watch that you roleplay any oddities you take because the GM will be looking for them and may penalize you for not role playing them.
