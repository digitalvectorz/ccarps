Prestige
========
Prestige will give positive effects to your roll, such as reducing your target number in success tests, or adding modifier dice. This is by no means an exhaustive list of prestiges.

Ambidextrous - 5 points
-----------------------
You are equally effective with either hand and never suffer the usual -4 target number penalty when using your "off" hand.

Animal Empathy - 5 points
-------------------------
You are quite talented at understanding animal motivations. When you come in contact with an animal, the GM rolls against your Perception and tells you the overall emotional state of the animal. You will know whether it is scared, hostile, hungry, etc. If it is under the control of another, this may also be revealed. Animal Empathy also allows you to use influence skills on animals.

Catfall - 10 points
-------------------
You fall with grace. Automatically subtract five yards from your fall immediately. This counds as an automatic Acrobatics success. Successful Dexterity rolls reduce damage from falls by half. Your limbs and body must be unbound and free to move while you fall.

Combat Reflexes - 15 points
---------------------------
You are rarely surprise, and you have extraordinary reaction times. All active defense rolls gain +1 to target number. Fright checks gain +2 to target number, and you never "freeze" in surprise situations. Furthermore, you gain +6 to target number for waking up or recovering from a surprise attack or mental stun.

Danger Sense - 15 points
------------------------
Sometimes you just know when something bad is going to happen. The GM rolls once against your Perception (in secret), anytime you're in a situation involving ambush, impending doom, or similar. On a success, you gain enough warning that you can take action. On a critical success, you gain some detail as to the nature of the danger.

Empathy - 15 points
-------------------
You have a strong connection to the emotions of others. When you first meet someone or are reunited after an extended period, you may ask the GM to roll against your Intelligence. They will tell you what you "feel" about that person. If the roll fails, the GM will _lie_. This is great for figuring out loyalties, finding impotsters, etc.

Enhanced Defenses - 5-15 points
----------------------------------
You are unusually good at avoiding attacks. Whether this is due to careful observation of your enemy, focusing your energy, or whatever fits your background. There are three types:
* _Enhanced Block:_ Block and Shield skills gain +1 to their target number. _5 points_
* _Enhanced Dodge:_ +1 to target number when using Dodge or similar skills. _15 points_
* _Enhanced parry:_ +1 to target number when Parrying. May take for bare hands (_5 points_), melee weapons (_5 points_), or all parries (_10 points_).

Fearless - 2 points per level
-----------------------------
You are not easily intimidated or frightened. Add your level of Fearless to your target number whenever you make a Fright check, resist Intimidation, or a power that induces fear.

Flexible - 5-15 points
----------------------
You are exceptionally flexible. There are two levels:
* _Flexibility:_ +3 to target number for climibng or escaping rolls to get free of ropes, handcuffs, and other similar restraints. You may ignore up to -3 in penalties for working in confined spaces (including many Explosives and Mechanics rolls). _5 points_
* _Double-Jointed:_ A more extreme version of the above. You cannot stretch or squeeze yourself abnormally, but any part of your body may bend in any way. You gain +5 to target numbers on Climbing, Escapting and attempts to free yourself from restraints, and may ignore up to -5 in penalties for working in confined spaces. _15 points_

High Pain Tolerance - 10 points
-------------------------------
While you can be injured just like anyone else, you don't necessarily feel it as much. You never suffer a shock penalty when you are injured, and you gain +3 to target number when avoiding knockdown and stunning. If you are physically tortured, you gain +3 to target numbers to resist.

Keen Perception - 2 points per level
------------------------------------
You have amazingly honed senses. Each sense is a separate prestige that gives +1 to target number per level to all Intelligence rolls you make (or the GM makes on your behalf), using that one sense. Applies to hearing, taste, touch, sight, and smell.

Language Talents - 10 points
----------------------------
You easily pick up languages. When you learn a language at a comprehension level above None, your automatically function at the next higher level.

Lucky - Varies
--------------
You were born lucky. There are three levels of being Lucky:
* _Lucky:_ Once per hour of play, you may reroll a single bad die roll twice and take the best of the three rolls. You must declare that you are using your Luck immediately after you roll the dice. _15 points_
* _Very Lucky:_ The same above, but usable every 30 minutes. _30 points_
* _Stupid Lucky:_ The same as above but usable every 10 minutes. _60 points_
Lucky only applies to your own success, damage, or reaction rolls, or on outside events that affect you or your whole party, or when you are being attacked, in which case you may make the attacker rolll three times and take the _worst_ roll.

Madcap - 15 points
------------------
Luck favors the risky, and you are just that! Any time you take an unneccesary risk (according to the GM), you gain +1 to the target number of all skill rolls. In addition, you get to reroll one critical failure during high-risk behavior.

Night Vision - 1 point per level
--------------------------------
Your eyes adapt easily to the dark. Each level of this ability (up to nine) allows you to add +1 to target numbers for vision penalties due to darkness, provided there's some sort of light source.

Perfect Balance - 15 points
---------------------------
You never lose your footing, no matter how narrow the walking surface is (tightrope, ledge, etc.) under normal conditions without having to make a die roll. If the surface is wet or unstable, you gain + to all target numbers to keep your balance. In combat, you gain +4 to target numbers for Dexterity-based skills to keep your balance or avoid being knocked down. You also gain +1 to target numbers when using Acrobatics and Climbing skills.

Resistance - Varies
-------------------
Your resistance (and possible immunity) to disease and poisons is remarkable. This gives you a bonus on all rolls to avoid incapacitation or injury from these things.
* _Resistance to Disease:_ You may take +3 to target numbers for 3 points, or +8 for 5 points.
* _Reistance to Poison:_ You have a +3 to target number when resisting poisons, for 5 points.

Talented - Varies
-----------------
You have a natural aptitude for a set of closely-knit skills. These 'talents' come in various levels and give a bonus of +1 to target number per level with all affected skills, even for default use, but _only_ for those skills. This is an inexpensive and alternate way to become adept in a small set of skills.

You may never have more than four levels of a particular talent set, however, overlapping talent sets _can_ give skill bonuses (only) in excess of +4. The cost of a telent set depends on the size of the group of skills. Here's a few examples:
* _Artificer:_ Armory, Electronics Repair, Engineering, Mechanic, and similar. _10 points per level_
* _Outdoorsman:_ Camouflage, Naturalist, Navigation, Survival, and Tracking. _10 points per level_
* _Smooth Operator:_ Influence skills as well as Acting, Carousing, Leadership and Public Speaking. _15 points per level_
