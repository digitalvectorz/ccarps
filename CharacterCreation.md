Character Creation
==================

Primary Attributes
------------------
There are five primary attributes:

> S = Strength
> D = Dexterity
> C = Constitution
> I = IQ / Intelligence
> W = Will

The primary attributes are based on a Human character for other races like Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Troll, and Gnome will use die modifiers to enhance and detract from the base attributes (see racial modifier table).

Legendary characters eg. Hercules, must be over 21 yrs of age; roll ten sets of 5d6, sum the five highest rolls (the sum should be >= 120 points), divide the total among the five primary attributes at will.

Epic characters eg. Beowulf, must be over 21 yrs of age; roll six sets of 5d6 sum the five highest rolls ( the sum should be >= 100 points ), divide the total among the five primary attributes at will.

Heroic; roll five sets of d6 according to the age specific attribute table and record them in a list, then assign each roll to an attribute in any order.

Advanced; roll five sets of d6 according to the age specific attribute table, record each roll as it occurs in the attribute of your choice.

Novice; roll five sets of d6 according to the age specific attribute table and record the rolls in each attribute in the order as they appear eg. roll 1 = S, roll 2 = D, etc.

Secondary Attributes
--------------------
> Charisma = avg(C,I,W);
> Speed = avg(S,D);
> Attack = avg(S,D,W);
> Lift = avg(S,W);
> Reaction = avg(I,W);

Character Points
----------------
At character creation initial character points are equal to the sum total of your character.s primary attributes Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, and Willpower. During character creation, character points are used to buy Oddities, Prestige, Prejudice, and Skills.

Prestige, Prejudice, and Oddities
---------------------------------
These may only be taken at character creation. They are used to gain advantages and to make trade offs to provide flexibility and role play interest in character options,or to add .character. to your characters.

Prestige will give positive effects to your roll such as reducing your die rolls in success tests or adding modifier dice.

Prejudice will bring negative effects to your character and therefore cost negative points to acquire, by taking a prejudice you can add points to your total to be spent on Prestige, oddities, or skills.

Oddities are just that, they can enhance your character in some situations and detract from it in others. Generally they are less noticeable than Prestige and Prejudice, but serve to create the same effects.

Skills
------
Skills determine what your character can and cannot do as well as what they know and don.t know. No character may use a skill that they have no knowledge of. Adding one initial point to a skill is the equivalent of the character reading a basic instruction manual or taking an introductory lesson from someone who knows the skill at an advanced level or higher. This gives the character the ability to use the skill with no special proficiency.

Character Appearance
--------------------
The appearance of a given character is mostly up to the player; however, it is a good idea to use character attributes as guidelines.

Example: The range of possible values is 5 to 30 for an adult aged character (over 21). Armed with this information, just as we would consider a person with an intelligence of 5 to be an imbecile, we would consider a person with a 5 in charisma to be repulsive. Therefore, it would be unusual for a good looking character to have a low charisma unless he or she had a detriment that modifies charisma such as .evil spirited. which will give a -15 to charisma. As for the stature of a character, the following table will give the average height of characters by race, the actual height of a character can vary as much as plus or minus one foot, for example: a tall human could be as much as 7ft or as little as 5ft tall. GM Note: feel free to add in any race or body type you feel would enhance your world. You are welcome to use the races listed here as templates but such consideration is not required. You are the God of your world after all.

Character Background
--------------------
This is pretty much open to the players creativity. Background story can go a long way toward identifying a character.s habits of mind, body, and spirit. This can aid the player in making good believable decisions and greatly enhance the role play experience as well as add to the group dynamics. So put some thought into this part, make it interesting and be creative. Prestige, Prejudice, and oddities can go a long way to help with good back story.

Wealth and Influence
--------------------
Wealth is a measure of a characters accumulation of material value, including things such as property (home, car, horses), finery (cloths, tools, weapons), and currency.

Influence is measured by the number of people you have in your contact list, and the quality of the contact relationship eg. a low quality contact will accept your call and listen to your request, they may even provide information if asked the right question but the information has a 50% chance of being inaccurate. An average contact is like a good friend, you can trust them to tell you what they know but they have limited access to high level information. A high quality contact will have good access to information and be trustworthy and reliable.

Wealth and influence are considered to be Prestige, or Prejudice depending on the extreme to which your character is subject. For average wealth and influence there is no modifier and it can be taken for free. If wealth or influence are undefined at character creation they are considered to be average. Ask the Game Master for average currency and/or material, and connection values. The starting wealth is more a statement of the character.s upbringing than the character.s current status. The point gain or los is meant to represent the character.s perception of wealth and his or her ability to move in social circles. A person who was raised filthy rich would stand out like a sore thumb on skid row, just as a dirt poor person would at a country club.

Improving Your Character
------------------------
Adventure points are earned through adventuring. As a general rule, each player earns one point for each session that they actively role-play in a given campaign. Further points can be earned by; performing an action that directly furthers the plot, rolling a critical success on a plot related action, performing an action that helps the group at great risk to self, remaining in character when there is great pressure to break down the fourth wall, etc. each of the aforementioned actions earns one point for the character. Team points can be awarded in cases where the team makes a deliberate, unprovoked effort to coordinate their actions to further the plot.

Point assignment: Points must be assigned at the time they are given. Points cannot be stored up, at the beginning of any session where a character has unassigned points, those points must be assigned to an accumulator before play begins.

Adventure points can be spent on primary attributes and/or skills. To increase an attribute by one point a player must spend an amount of points equal to the current score of the attribute plus one. Example: Bob the bouncer has Strength of 20, to increase this to 21 he will put 21 points into the accumulator for strength. When the accumulator reaches the next target number, increment the attribute and reset the accumulator to zero. Once points are assigned to an accumulator for an attribute or skill they may not be moved or re-assigned. Skills can be increased by applying points to the skill accumulator for a desired skill, die bonuses are applied at 6 for Novice, 18 for Advanced, and 36 for Master. Example: Bob the bouncer has a brawling skill of 6 this gives him a 1d6 advantage when brawling, he wants to gain a 2d6 advantage Bob will have to spend 12 points on his brawling skill bringing the total skill points to 18 if Bob wants to be a Master Brawler he would have to add an additional 18 points to his brawling skill for a total of 36 points. The maximum points one can apply to any skill is 36. New skills can be added to your character at any time during play but they must be built up through the levels as points are added. Example: Bob the bouncer wants to add martial arts to his skill list to gain a block/parry advantage to his fighting skills. At the end of the session he has earned 3 adventure points, Bob will add the chosen skill to the list
