# What is *CCARPS*? #
Community Codex Adaptive RolePlay System, often referred to as its acronym, "*CCARPS*", is an open source ruleset licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike. This system has been developed to promote storytelling within a minimal ruleset. We believe that the game should be about the characters so the rules shouldn't get in the way of your story. This is a Community Codex; players and developers alike can actively participate in the shaping and refinement of this rule system. It is adaptive; the base rules are meant to be a generic starting point that can support any style of gameplay and world. While the main goal is roleplay, the system is built in a character-centric way that can be used to power any type of gameplay that involves tracking player statistics.

# The Essentials #

## Dice ##
*CCARPS* exclusively uses six-sided dice. Dice rolls are indicated by appending a "d" after the number of dice; "4d" means "four six-sided dice." Each player will utilize between two and five dice in an attempt to roll as low as possible. The number of dice a player rolls is determined by the character's skill dice for an applicable skill.

## Target Numbers ##
Any complex activity has an associated target number based on the difficulty of the task and the amount of time the character has to execute the task. Players use a number of dice to determine the outcome of these activities.

## Modifiers ##
Attributes, Skills, and some Oddities have Modifiers, as will some situational details, and equipment. These Modifiers are used to alter a given *Target Number*. Situational modifiers are applied to the base Target Number by the Game Master before or as the Target Number is given to the player depending on the Game Master's preference. Your character Modifiers *add* to the given Target Number. If it is a contested roll, the opposing side's Modifiers *reduce* the Target Number. The larger you can make the Target Number, the more likely your character will succeed.

## Rolling for Success ##
There is only one dice-roll mechanic in *CCARPS*: a base *Target Number* is assigned, all modifiers are applied to the base *Target Number*, and dice are rolled in an attempt to roll *lower than* the Target Number. This is achieved by using the two *lowest* dice in any dice roll set. This applies to all rolls, including the Game Master, NPCs, and creatures. The goal is to roll lower than the assigned Target Number. A Target Number is the base difficulty for performing an action under the current situational conditions. Modifiers do not affect dice rolls only target numbers. All modifiers from weapons, armor, and skills must be accounted for and the target number adjusted before the player rolls any dice for the given action.

*You are sneaking around (base target number 3) in a dark (+1) and unfamiliar (-2) place. You have a "Stealth" skill with a modifier of 3 and quiet shoes with a Modifier of 1. The base Target Number to sneak undetected is a 3 the Game Master will add in the situational modifiers +1 for dark -2 for unfamiliar = Target Number 2. You add your modifier to the Target Number (2 + 3 + 1); you must roll under a 6. You roll 3d and get a 3, 2, and 4. Adding up the two lowest dice, the result is 5. You are successfully stealthy.*

*A patrolman walks nearby, which contests your active "Stealth" skill. The Base Target Number is equal to your success roll of 5. You stop moving to push the number down by 1 for a Target Number of 4. The patrolman has a "Detect" skill modifier of 3, which brings the Target Number up to 7. The patrolman rolls 3d and gets a 5, 6 and 2. Remembering that the lowest two dice are the only ones that matter, they are added for a total of 7. The patrolman fails to detect you.*

*CCARPS* has three types of Target Number modification:

* Simple Target Number: Base Target Number + situational modifiers.
* Skilled Target Number: Simple Target Number + your applicable Modifiers
* Opposed Target Number: Skilled Target Number - opposition's applicable Modifiers

## Degrees of Success ##
There are some situations where an Oddity or Skill's action will depend on the *Degree of Success*. To find the *Degree of Success*, subtract the successful roll from the Target Number. The difference is the Degree of Success.

*Coming across a stray dog, you use your "Animal Empathy" skill to assess its hostility. The Target Number is 5 and you roll a 3. Subtract 3 from 5 to find Your Degree of Success: 5 - 3 = 2, which is enough to tell you that the dog is happy, but has most likely lost its owner.*

## Critical Success, Critical Failure ##
A *Critical Success* happens when all dice in a roll set are 1. The more dice you roll, the more often you will succeed, but the harder it is to get a *Critical Success*. A *Critical Success* means the action succeeds and has a better than expected result. The more dice in a set, the more amazing a critical will be.

Conversely, a *Critical Failure* happens when all dice in a roll set are 6. It becomes harder to critically fail when you roll more dice. A *Critical Failure* has worse than expected results. The more dice in a rolled set, the more dangerous the *Critical Fail* will be.

## Automatic Success ##
There are a lot of actions that characters will take that are trivial or common sense. These do not require a roll and are counted as automatically succeeding. The only time these will need a roll are when there are adverse conditions (weather, battle, impeding injury, etc.) or when the Game Master says.

*Walking in a straight line on a summer day would have no roll. Attempting to walk in a straight line on sheet ice during a snow storm would require a roll to keep footing and a roll to maintain the correct direction of travel.*

## Disposition ##
The sum of a character's Attributes, Health, Oddities, and Skills, is referred to as their *Disposition*. A character's *Disposition* is tendency to act in a specific way. Much like the real world, a character's skill set, demeanor, and overall health oftentimes shines through in their personality. This can be said as generalizations for groups, communities, and nations as well.

* **Attributes** are the core of a character. They greatly influence everything about the character. The base Attributes are averaged into secondary Attributes and converted into modifiers through a personal/skill modifier table to make Skill creation and use easier, as well as to more accurately reflect the nature of attributes as a complex system.

* **Health Meter** is the sum of a character's Mental, Physical, and Spiritual health. The healthiest characters have nothing checked or marked in these boxes.

* **Oddities** are traits that are taken at character creation and provide a defining factor in a character's strengths and weaknesses, while also providing fuel for creative roleplay. Oddities have a permanent passive effect on the character; they may boost skill sets, but may come at a cost of Health detriments (or the other way around).

* **Skills** are learned abilities that your character possesses. These are what a character knows how to do.
