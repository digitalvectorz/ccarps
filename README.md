The *Community Codex Adaptive RolePlay System*, or CCARPS, is a modular game ruleset / framework. We were deeply unsatisfied by other rulesets and their accompanying license terms, so we set out to create one that we wanted to use.

CCARPS is free to use under the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). The name for attribution is `WizardSpire Games`.

If you do use CCARPS, please let us know! We would love to see what everyone makes!
